Graphic designer based in Tokyo with over 10 years of professional experience.
I am passionate about design because I love colors and continuously try to achieve a beautiful balance in my work.
I enjoy experimenting with layout and color combinations.
I have been an art director for various international fashion brands (casual and sports) and also have experience with freelance work.
